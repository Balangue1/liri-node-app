# liri-node-app

This application is called LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Liri input parameters are:

'my-tweets'             Calls the twitter API to retrieve last 20 tweets

'spotify-this-song'     Calls the node-spotify-api to retrieve information                              about a song (work in progress)

'movie-this'            Calls the OMDB API based on movie title

'do-what-it-says'       Calls an external text file to run parameters (work in                          progress)
